# cljs-snake

A Clojurescript implementation of the classic snake game.

## Usage
####
lein cljsbuild once # you only need to do this once

lein figwheel # then point your browser at localhost:3449
####

Arrow keys, ijkl, click or touch within the playfield to control the snake (and disable the ai).  The 'a' key toggles the ai.
  
Any other key resets the game.

You can see the game running at http://debhal.github.io/cljs-snake/
and should work on desktop or mobile browsers.
